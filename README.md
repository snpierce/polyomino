# React + TypeScript + Vite

Static version of Polyomino Word Puzzle.

Loads pre-saved board into play state. The goal is to rearrange tiles in order to fill the 4x4 grid and have every row and column be a word. There is also a timer and a feature for looking up definitions of a word after playing. Note that the dataset of words is not pure, and may contain abbreviations such as "bldg" or "appt", or names of people and places. The area around the grid is "scrap paper", so you can move tiles off of the board. Enjoy!
